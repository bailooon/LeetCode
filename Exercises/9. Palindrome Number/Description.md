# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

## Example 1:
<p>Input: x = 121</p>
<p>Output: true</p>
<p>Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.</p>


## Example 2:
<p>Input: x = -121</p>
<p>Output: false</p>
<p>Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</p>


## Example 3:
<p> Input: x = 10</p>
<p>Output: false</p>
<p>Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. </p>
